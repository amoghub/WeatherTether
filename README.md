# WeatherTether

WeatherTether is a weather application built to provide accurate and descriptive weather to an inputted location. Users can change the weather location by inputting a city / country into a text field. Users can also change the degree type through a convenient switch, next to the location textfield. 

# Code and API Usage

WeatherTether uses the most renouned API for weather information and hourly forecasts: OpenWeather API. Link for the API can be found here: https://openweathermap.org/api

By linking the location name to the OpenWeather API, WeatherTether is able to obtain a JSON formatted text, which is then split into different sections of the screen. This allows for a clean and efficient way of seeing what the weather is like, along with a description of the forecast.

# WeatherTether

WeatherTether is a weather application built to provide accurate and descriptive weather to an inputted location. Users can change the weather location by inputting a city / country name into a text field. Users can also change the degree type through a convenient switch, next to the input location textfield. 

# Code and API Usage

WeatherTether uses the most renouned API for weather information and hourly forecasts: OpenWeather API. 

Link for the API can be found here: https://openweathermap.org/api

By linking the inputted city given by the user and the API's server requests, WeatherTether is able to obtain a JSON formatted text, which is then split into different sections of the screen, allowing the user to have a clean and efficient way of seeing what the weather is like and a description of the forecast.
